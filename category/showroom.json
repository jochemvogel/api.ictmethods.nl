		"practice": "Benchmark tests are regularly used to test pattern recognition software. If a standard set of data is recognised with the software, the results can be compared to that of other software. Benchmarks are also used to compare hardware or software in which performance plays an important role (e.g. how many forms can automatically be processed per minute, in comparison to other software).",

Involve experts on the given standard to ensure that all aspects of the standard are addressed. If a standard is used for external communication, certification by an external body is required.",
