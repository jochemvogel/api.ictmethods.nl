# ICT Methods API

[Link to main repo](https://github.com/jochemvogel/ictmethods.nl)

Just some json files that are being used as API. There is no server needed (just static file delivery) and there are no extra request. This was the fastest and easiest way to implement this.

The methods are not changing, so there is no need for a CMS.

## ICT Research Methods API

There is ICT Research Methods (MediaWiki) API, but that only has some meta data. Because of that there is decided to create a customer API. Now it has all the data that is needed in the preferable format.

## Improvements

Improvements are always welcome of course.
